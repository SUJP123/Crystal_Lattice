# Crystal_Lattice
#This project consists of a basic generator of random configurations of Lennard Jones particles in low-density fluid. The package used in this program is hoomd which allows analysis and simulations of molecular dynamics and particle physics. 

The generator uses the system with an initial condition in an FCC structure and then applies forces in the integrator to create a random configuration.

Note, that the program will ask for the user to create file names that must end in (.gsd), and can be opened in software such as Ovito.
